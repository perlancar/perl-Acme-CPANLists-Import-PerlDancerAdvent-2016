<p>
The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="asynchronous_dancer2"></a>Asynchronous Dancer2</h1>

<p>A long awaited feature in Dancer2 is asynchronous (delayed) streaming
responses. These are a lot of words, but what they eventually translate
to is the ability to respond without blocking additional actions on the
same thread. That still doesn't mean much. Let's see if we can clarify
that.</p>
<h2><a name="blocking_and_non_blocking_outside_web"></a>Blocking and non-blocking outside web</h2>

<p>By default, all code in Perl is run synchronously, or in other words,
blocking. This means that no single action runs until the previous
action ends.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
    my $result = run_action();
    ...
}</pre>

<p>If we wish to run more than one action at the same time, and assuming
they are not dependent on each other, we can use multiple processes:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
    my $pid = fork();
    defined $pid
        or die "Cannot fork: $!\n";

    if ( $pid == 0 ) {
        my $result = run_action();
        ...
    } else {
        # this is the parent
        # which is meaningless here...
    }
}</pre>

<p>This will run each of them separately. If we have an event loop, we can
schedule these actions using the event loop and provide a callback for
handling the results:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">for ( 1 .. 10 ) {
    # this isn't a real function
    # it depends on your event loop of choice
    schedule_action_on_event_loop( sub {
        my $result = shift;
        ...
    } );
}</pre>

<h2><a name="within_the_web_environment"></a>Within the web environment</h2>

<p>When working on a website, any response which takes a while to complete
will hang the entire thread waiting for the action to finish and the
user to receive a response. Additionally, any request which requires
multiple blocking functions, it will take longer to complete, since we
wait for each request.</p>
<p>In order to handle this, a common technique is to use asynchronous
syntax. Not all event loops support them and many provide their own
event loop in order to handle it, forcing you to use their syntax only.</p>
<p>Dancer2 recently added asynchronous syntax which is not bound to any
existing event loop, making it possible to pick your own.</p>
<h2><a name="asynchronous_in_dancer2"></a>Asynchronous in Dancer2</h2>

<p>Let's assume we want to run a web server with a single thread that does
not fork. We can handle multiple users by responding asynchronously
without forcing the next user to wait in line:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/' =&gt; sub {
    delayed {
        flush;
        content template 'index';
        done;
    };
};</pre>

<p>This is a simple endpoint that doesn't do anything special, but it
allows us to understand the existing syntax before we try something
more complicated.</p>
<p>The <code>delayed</code> keyword begins an asynchronous response. It registers
within your web server (which should be an asynchronous web server,
mind you) a response to run asynchronously.</p>
<p>The <code>flush</code> keyword sends the headers to the user, allowing you to
begin sending content to the user. This is when you begin to stream
data.</p>
<p>The <code>content</code> keyword sends data to the user. Every time you call
<code>content</code>, no matter how many times, you will stream additional data.
This data will be sent while being able to handle additional
connections and clients within the single process of the web server.</p>
<p>The <code>done</code> keyword is simply the way to tell the server to close the
connection with the user. You can then continue to run code, but the
user will no longer be connected to your web server.</p>
<p>So when is this really useful? Let's imagine a situation in which we
would like to make several requests to remote servers, and then send
the user all of them. We will use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/AnyEvent">AnyEvent</a> as our event loop of
choice (which will run with the <code>Twiggy</code> web server.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">use Dancer2;
use AnyEvent;
use AnyEvent::HTTP;

my @urls = qw&lt;...&gt;;

get '/' =&gt; sub {
    delayed {
        flush;

        # keep track of responses with a condvar
        my $cv = AnyEvent-&gt;condvar;

        # decide what happens when all responses arrive
        $cv-&gt;cb( delayed { done; } );

        foreach my $url (@urls) {
            $cv-&gt;begin;
            http_get $url, delayed {
                my ( $headers, $body ) = @_;
                content $body;
                $cv-&gt;end;
            };
        }
    };
};</pre>

<p>You will notice several new things here.</p>
<p>Firstly, we're using a condition variable (<code>condvar</code>), which helps us
track all requests. Each time we are about to issue one, we count it
using <code>begin</code>. Every time we receive a response, we track it with
<code>end</code>.</p>
<p>You might also notice we replaced every <code>sub</code> call with <code>delayed</code>.
The way <code>delayed</code> works is that it creates an asynchronous <code>sub</code> that
has the DSL available. This means that, simply put, every time you wish
to have a <code>sub</code> call and use Dancer2 keywords inside it, just replace
the word <code>sub</code> with <code>delayed</code>. Everything else is the same.</p>
<p>And lastly, we set the <code>done</code> keyword before we run the requests,
which doesn't necessarily make much sense, because it happens after.
This is how it works with asynchronous programming.</p>
<p>Take into account that other event loop might have other syntax, but
they should all be similar enough.</p>
<h2><a name="future"></a>Future</h2>

<p>We have plans on introducing websockets in the future, and they as
well, will be asynchronous and streaming.</p>
