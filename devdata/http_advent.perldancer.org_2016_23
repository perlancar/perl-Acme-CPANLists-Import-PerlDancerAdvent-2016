The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<p>XSS (fancy-talk for "Cross Side Scripting") is the security attack of
injecting javascript into a page so that some other poor user will
accidentally run unintentionally (and often with no knowledge of it
either). Pretty cool, huh? Also pretty destructive.</p>
<h2><a name="the_trick_about_xss"></a>The trick about XSS</h2>

<p>The entire trick about XSS is that is works using a bigger principle
of which you must have heard: Code injection!</p>
<h2><a name="the_trick_about_code_injections"></a>The trick about code injections</h2>

<p>Code injections only work due to one mistake we make. Here is the
trick: trust. Trust is the problem. Just trust.</p>
<h2><a name="ne_never_"></a>Ne? Never!</h2>

<p>Of course we all know not to trust users. So why does this still
happen? Because we don't realize where we implicitly trust them.
Here's an example: Parameters in templates and queries.</p>
<h2><a name="templates"></a>Templates</h2>

<p>Probably the most common source of XSS attacks is our templates.</p>
<p>When we render a template, we provide a user with something to
display, but because it's HTML, we also provide them with something
they can <i>run</i>. If the template renders as HTML, the HTML can
contain Javascript. It can be at the end, or even embedded.</p>
<p><i>Every HTML can contain Javascript</i>.</p>
<p>Uh oh. This means that if we create the HTML... we can accidentally
create HTML that can contain Javascript. If a user can control how
the HTML is created, a user can control <i>what</i> kind of Javascript
is created with it, even if it wasn't supposed to contain any code.</p>
<p>Let's write a small example in Perl:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">my $name_from_user = prompt('Please enter your name: ');
render_template( 'template.tmpl', { 'name' =&gt; $name_from_user' } );</pre>

<p>Now let's assume the user gave the following as the name:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">Sawyer&lt;javascript&gt;alert("Hey, what's up?")&lt;/javascript&gt;</pre>

<p>This means that if we just use the variable <code>name</code> in the template,
we're accidentally adding Javascript code. Thus, XSS is born!</p>
<h2><a name="why_is_this_bad"></a>Why is this bad?</h2>

<p>Simple!</p>
<p>If I registered with that name, and Alice goes to a page that shows
all the usernames, then Alice gets HTML that has my code in it.
Alice's browser runs the Javascript and now gets a pop-up.</p>
<p>Next time instead of a pop-up, I can just have it send the current
browser cookies and passwords to some remote server I have.</p>
<p>Or maybe I want to force Alice to go to some other website using a
Javascript redirect and try to get her to purchase a product on
which I get a commission? (I honestly did not just come up with it,
I had to resolve such a problem.)</p>
<p>Or maybe one of the other options I have when I can just run any
Javascript code I want.</p>
<h2><a name="queries"></a>Queries</h2>

<p>Another such example of trusted parameters is in queries. By using
parameters we provided from the user in our queries, we provide
inherent trust in their content as legal, correct, valid, and
non-destructive SQL. That's often not the case, whether in honest
mistake or in malice.</p>
<p>If you are using value placeholders in <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/DBI">DBI</a>, you're at least ahead of
the curb, making sure it will get quoted correctly, but if you're just
creating your own SQL code by using variables in the construction,
you're putting yourself and your data at risk.</p>
<h2><a name="parameters"></a>Parameters</h2>

<p>But now you're thinking, "I know about this. I just escape all my
variables". Good job! But what do you do about parameters? Do you
validate and escape them before using them? Have you ever used a
parameter in your template?</p>
<p>Imagine the following code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/' =&gt; sub {
    my $name_from_user = query_parameters-&gt;get('name');

    # render the "index" template
    template 'index' =&gt; {
        'name' =&gt; $name_from_user,
    };
};</pre>

<p>The above code, the likes of which has been spotted by security,
does just that. He takes input from the user and sends it to the
template to be used. Injection complete.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">get '/' =&gt; sub {
    if ( failed_to_do_something ) {
        redirect '/error?This%20Failed';
    }

    ...
};</pre>

<p>Now we redirect to a page that uses the parameter to know <i>what</i>
the error message is, it's content verbatim. A user that sees it
can provide a different error instead and send it to someone else,
in which case the error string can be javascript code that steals
information. Whoops again!</p>
<h2><a name="fixes"></a>Fixes</h2>

<p>To fix, we can apply any of the following mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Continue to HTML escape <i>every</i> variable used, either in routing code
or in the template.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check user input better. If it's not a simple string, it fails. Make
sure you allow Unicode character where appropriate!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the example of the error, we could provide a key for a known error
(like <code>/error?ErrorID=1</code>) and check that it's only a digit and only
display the correlating error messages, which we have full control
over.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Escaping in the template is a good practice, since it is the boundary
between one system and another. However, the boundary between the user
input and your variables exists as well, and defending against it is
also important.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The conclusion is simple: Parameters are not variables.</p>
<p>While many of the template variables were at some point parameters from
a user, there is still a fundamental difference between them. This difference
(which makes the basis for all of these mistakes) is that parameters and
template variables are substantially different things.</p>
<p>Parameters come from the user. Template variables come from us. While we can
trust ourselves (for the most part), we cannot trust what comes from the
user, whether it's maliciously or just an honest mistake.</p>
<p>Separating the two protects us from mistakenly using one verbatim for the
other, and keeping the security team off our back. :)</p>
