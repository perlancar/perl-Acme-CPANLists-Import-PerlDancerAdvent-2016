<p>
The PerlDancer Advent Calendar is a community-driven project that aims 
to showcase the Dancer Perl web framework.
</p>

<p>
Each day of December until Christmas, one article about Dancer. Stay tuned for new moves!

<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="optimizing_dancer2_pt__2"></a>Optimizing Dancer2 PT. 2</h1>

<p>In the previous article we explored the optional modules we can install
in order to make things run faster. Other than having them installed,
no special changes we required.</p>
<p>However, there are much greater changes we can make with greater value.
In this article we will discuss changes in our server configuration.</p>
<h2><a name="picking_your_server"></a>Picking your server</h2>

<p>While <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack">Plack</a> has a built-in server, you wouldn't want to use this.
For many the go-to server is Apache, due to its stability and
feature abundance. However, its performance is sub-optimal at times.</p>
<p>If you're already running a Perl application, you can opt for a
Perl-based web server. They perform exceedingly well. Servers like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Starman">Starman</a> or <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Gazelle">Gazelle</a> can provide high-performance.</p>
<p>If you're interested in seeking alternatives, <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/uWSGI">...</a> provides
a fast web server with support for PSGI protocol. It also one
additional special feature: Asynchronous cleanup handlers, which
allow you to asynchronously handle cleanup tasks such as clearing
intermediate objects, write to disk, log, etc.</p>
<h2><a name="faster_sessions"></a>Faster sessions</h2>

<p>Applications tend to use sessions.</p>
<p>Picking the right session storage is a matter of balance, as with
many things. If you are looking for speed, forget about the file-based
session storage like JSON or YAML or Sereal. Instead, use Redis or
Memcached.</p>
<h2><a name="static_file_serving"></a>Static file serving</h2>

<p>All your static files are normally served by Dancer2 using a static
middleware. It works, but it's far from the fastest solution.</p>
<p>Many web servers support serving static files for you, especially if
they are also a reverse proxy. NGINX is a fast web server and reverse
proxy that can serve the static files for you, with much greater speed,
and then run your web application for everything else.</p>
<p>If you serve the static files through a different mechanism, you
can disable the middleware in Dancer2 that handles it:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint"># in your config.yml:
static_handler: 0

# or in your MyApp.pm
set 'static_handler' =&gt; 0;</pre>

<p>Dancer2 will then generate a faster web application by not even
checking for static files at all.</p>
<p>(This is touching your stack structure, which we will delve into
further in the next blog post in this series.)</p>
<h2><a name="https___where_appropriate"></a>HTTPS - where appropriate</h2>

<p>Security is important but it's not without cost.</p>
<p>HTTPS adds additional processing and network time. You might want
to reduce some of it for critical parts of the website that do
not require security. This is usually a meager amount, but it's
worth noting.</p>
<p>Take into account, though, that you could lose much more if you
make a mistake and do not enable HTTPS where it is needed. In
many cases it's preferable to just keep it rather than be in
doubt.</p>
<h2><a name="coming_next"></a>Coming next</h2>

<p>In the next article, we will focus on our stack and explore the
architectural changes we can make in order to speed up our web
applications.</p>
