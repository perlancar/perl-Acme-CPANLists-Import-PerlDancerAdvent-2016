<div class="pod-document"><h1><a name="another_year_of_dancing"></a>Another year of dancing</h1>

<p>It's been a while since we had an advent calendar. It's about time.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what we've been up to in the last year. Well,
a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_New_members"></a><b>New members</b>
<p>Please welcome two new core team members:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Peter___SysPete__Mottram"></a><b>Peter (@SysPete) Mottram</b>
<p>If you have raised an issue, you have likely interacted with Peter. He
takes care of the queue, co-organizes the conferences, and managed the
entire transition to the new plugin architecture, helping authors by
testing their code and transitioning the syntax.</p>
<p>Oh, new plugin architecture? More to follow.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Jason___CromeDome__Crome"></a><b>Jason (@CromeDome) Crome</b>
<p>Jason Crome started by fixing up the documentation and moved on to help
with the releases themselves. If you looked up Dancer2 recently on CPAN,
you probably recognize his picture by now. :)</p>
<p>Jason's handling of the releases allows us to maintain a higher quality
of releases, including timing, announcements, and double checking the
important Pull Requests and issues are resolved prior to the release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_features"></a><b>New features</b>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Asynchronous_streaming_responses"></a><b>Asynchronous streaming responses</b>
<p>We have finally introduced the ability to provide asynchronous and
streaming responses. This allows you to do various interesting things,
but it can be quite complex.</p>
<p>This topic has its own article in this year's advent calendar. Stay
tuned!</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_prefix__code__supports_the_route_spec"></a><b><code>prefix</code> supports the route spec</b>
<p>The <code>prefix</code> syntax allowed you to reduce the repeated parts of strings,
and it now supports the full spec in order to allow you to reduce the
pattern strings:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">prefix '/:action' =&gt; sub {
    get '/:entity' =&gt; sub {...};
};</pre>

</li>
<li><a name="item__code_send_file__code__is_now_streaming"></a><b><code>send_file</code> is now streaming</b>
<p>The <code>send_file</code> keyword will now also stream the response asynchronously
if it's available. You don't need to think about it. You don't even know
it does it, but it does, automatically, or you. :)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_keywords"></a><b>New keywords</b>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_New_parameters_keywords"></a><b>New parameters keywords</b>
<p>We have introduced new keywords to retrieve information from the route,
query, or body parameters. They help handle common incorrect and risky
patterns.</p>
<p>They will also appear in their own advent article. Stay tuned!</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_header_keywords"></a><b>New header keywords</b>
<p>Noticing we only have headers to handle the response headers, we have
introduced several keywords to help you handle the request headers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item__code_request_header__code__"></a><b><code>request_header</code>.</b>
<p>Return the request header.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_response_header__code__"></a><b><code>response_header</code>.</b>
<p>A more explicit alternative to <code>header</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_response_headers__code__"></a><b><code>response_headers</code>.</b>
<p>A more explicit alternative to <code>headers</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_push_response_header__code__"></a><b><code>push_response_header</code>.</b>
<p>A more explicit alternative to <code>push_header</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice you cannot <i>push</i> a request header. This is on purpose,
since request headers should not change, they only represent the request
you received.</p>
<p>(We might eventually deprecate the general <code>header</code> and <code>push_header</code>
keywords.)</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_send_as__code_"></a><b><code>send_as</code></b>
<p>The <code>send_as</code> keyword gets around the serializer.</p>
<p>Interested? It has its own advent article!</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Local_config_files"></a><b>Local config files</b>
<p>You can now provide additional local configuration files that will be
loaded, but can be kept out of a version control repository.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for an article on that!</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_config_option__code_change_session_id__code_"></a><b>New config option <code>change_session_id</code></b>
<p>We have added a configuration option for improved security in cookies.
We will feature an article on them as well.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_keywords__code_encode_json__code____code_decode_json__code_"></a><b>New keywords <code>encode_json</code>, <code>decode_json</code></b>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_template__code__keyword_global"></a><b><code>template</code> keyword global</b>
<p>The <code>template</code> keyword can now be used outside a request. The relevant
request-specific variables will not be available (since it's outside a
request), but everything else will be available.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item__code_eval__code__shim"></a><b><code>eval</code> shim</b>
<p>You now have a shim for <code>eval</code> behavior. If you need such an option,
you already understand what it means.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Support_304_Not_Modified"></a><b>Support 304 Not Modified</b>
<p>We properly support <b>304 Not Modified</b> when serving static files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_documentation"></a><b>New documentation</b>
<p>We have revamped our documentation.</p>
<p>The original documentation had irrelevant parts from Dancer 1 which no
longer apply to Dancer 2, outdated components, unclear and confusing
descriptions, and quite honestly, were hard to navigate.</p>
<p>The rewritten documentation focus on clarifying how a Dancer 2 program is
constructed, the definitions we use and what they mean, the important
keywords, and how to use the syntax.</p>
<p>It does not delve into deprecated patterns, nor does it explain it. The
reasoning is that you could find it if you search, but we don't want to
teach you what you shouldn't be doing.</p>
<p>Documentation is a live project at any given time and our documentation
is no different. This means we always need additional help with it. If you
find something to improve, please let us know. We would appreciate your
help.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Memory_leaks_sealed"></a><b>Memory leaks sealed</b>
<p>We have become better at identifying memory leaks and resolved a few
important ones. We've also added various tests to improve our detection,
which so far yield no additional ones.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Speedups"></a><b>Speedups</b>
<p>Prompted by a user mentioning they still use Dancer 1 because it is faster,
we have pushed hard and sped up Dancer 2 by quite a bit. It now does not
match Dancer 1, but surpasses it.</p>
<p>Here are some of the specific work we did:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="item_Optimized_routing"></a><b>Optimized routing</b>
<p>The routing itself has been optimized. We have a few more plans for this
part, but it is now faster and better.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Fewer_layers__fewer_dependencies"></a><b>Fewer layers, fewer dependencies</b>
<p>We removed various layers (such as Middlewares) and removed some
dependencies in order to get more direct access to faster components.</p>
<p>We're learning where we can push more against abstractions and when we need
to use them despite possible slower performance.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Better_request_object"></a><b>Better request object</b>
<p>Our request object has been rewritten. It was originally our own custom
object, written from scratch, but now it subclasses the useful
<a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Plack::Request">Plack::Request</a> while adding Dancer-specific bits or components that were
rejected from being included in the basic Plack class.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Faster_headers"></a><b>Faster headers</b>
<p>We now internally use a faster header library, which is also used by Plack
itself: <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::Headers::Fast">HTTP::Headers::Fast</a>. We recommend using <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::XSHeaders">HTTP::XSHeaders</a>
which we co-authored, which will speed your headers substantially.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Faster_cookies"></a><b>Faster cookies</b>
<p>We will optionally use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/HTTP::XSCookies">HTTP::XSCookies</a> if it's available in order to
speed up the cookie handling.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_Faster_serializers_and_config_loader"></a><b>Faster serializers and config loader</b>
<p>The JSON serializer will use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JSON::MaybeXS">JSON::MaybeXS</a> which will optionally use
an XS implementation of <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/JSON">JSON</a>, if available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a name="item_DancerConf_2015_and_DancerConf_2016"></a><b>DancerConf 2015 and DancerConf 2016</b>
<p>We have held two conferences over the last two years.</p>
<p>While we're still working on the videos for DancerConf 2016, you can
already find the videos for DancerConf 2015 on
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbU5R-SHbDE&amp;list=PLf1KDvMbyeCQq4mkMt8jDPzS9uPUX_mNo">YouTube!</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a name="item_New_plugin_architecture"></a><b>New plugin architecture</b>
<p>The plugin architecture in Dancer 2 was one of the big remaining weak
points. We had to resolve it.</p>
<p>It had now been completely rewritten, and it has its own advent article
in this calendar!</p>
